What Does This Bot Do?
This Twitch bot detects when a specific Twitch user is live and sends a notification to a designated Discord channel to inform users in the Discord community. This can help increase engagement by notifying people when the user goes live.

The bot is also designed to be easily extendable. You could add additional platforms, such as Twitter, to help further increase visibility and traction for a userâ€™s channel.
